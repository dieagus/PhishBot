I'd consider it an error.

I think a proto cannot be expected to work retroactively.  In fact, I
think it's probably an error to declare a proto after a non-proto in the
same scope.

I believe ""veto"" is giving the wrong idea here as something that
happens after the fact.  What's the term for only allowing ""acceptable""
candidates to put their names on the ballot?  Anyway, as TSa surmises,
the ballot is vetted or stacked in advance--only those candidates
that *could* bind are considered to be part of the candidate set.
In the abstract, candidates that cannot match never get their names
on the ballot, though of course an implementation might choose to
determine this lazily as long as it preserves the same semantics.

Alternately, even if the list of valid candidates is determined
eagerly, if the candidate list construction is memoized based on the
typeshape of the Capture, it will generally not have to be redone
until you see a different typeshape (where the meaning of ""different""
may depend on how specific the signatures are, and in particular on
whether any of the signatures rely on subset constraints (including
individual values, which are just degenerate subsets)).

Thanks for the quick response, Carlos!  Unfortunately, this command
gives me only the /dev/sdX device file.  But sg_start don't work on
this.  sg_start wants to operate on the ""generic scsi device"" /dev/sgY.
Please notice, there is the 'g' instead of 'd' in the device name and
the sg devices have a number attached instead of a letter.

No requirements in particular.  See http://wiki.python.org/moin/BuildBot
Pretty much it should have good network connectivity and someone we
can contact who can administer the box.  For example, in the past we
have had to have ports opened up so the tests can pass.  Possibly we
might want to get different version of libraries installed to test
with (e.g., berkeley db v 4.x).

These boxes are fine and faster than half the current machines.

It would be best if we get configurations we don't already have.  We
have no NetBSD boxes.  We have one FreeBSD (6.2 supposedly), although
it's 32-bit.

Don't confuse envelope rewrites with header rewrites. The envelope
recipient need ony be rewritten once via virtual_alias_maps (virtual(5)).
No inverse mapping is required. All sites have the same data mapping the

Because of overloaded numification it cant be written that way. If I
overload nummification I can make that return 42 everytime. :-)

However given that they are doing the rebless logic i dont see why the
regex part is required.

     sub refaddr($) {
       my $pkg = ref($_[0]) or return undef;
       if (blessed($_[0])) {
         bless $_[0], 'Scalar::Util::Fake';
       }
       else {
         $pkg = undef;
       }
       my $i = 0+$_[0];
       bless $_[0], $pkg if defined $pkg;
       $i;
     }

Alternatively the entire rebless logic could be chucked and replaced
with a call to overload::StrVal() which i think has been around as
long as overload has,then the regex part could stay. I could have
sworn there was a numeric equivelent to overload::StrVal(), but i cant
find it documented, which suggests that if it does exist it hasnt
always, which is why the code doesnt use that.

I guess however the objective could have been to avoid using overload
at all. Alternatively it could be a speed issue. overload::StrVal() is
pretty slow as far as I recall.

Core code that looks this crufty is usually that way for a reason. ;-)

In that vein, I think the monthly alphas may also help as a means for 
setting personal deadlines for things we're working on. ""Implement for 
2.6"" is a bit of a wishy-washy deadline at some vague point in the 
future - it doesn't provide much impetus to sit down and spend an 
afternoon or evening getting it done. ""Implement for next 2.6 alpha, 
which will be cut in 3 weeks, 2 days and 16 hours"" is a real concrete 
target that can be aimed for (even if I'm the only person that knows I'm 
aiming for it for a given bug fix or feature).

It should also motivate at least a monthly review of the buildbot 
status, and is already motivating a push towards making the buildbots a 
more reliable indicator of the health of the source tree.

Sure, they may mostly be internal milestones (with third parties waiting 
for a feature-complete alpha or the first beta), but I think there is a 
decent chance the approach will turn out to be beneficial.

Cheers,
Nick.

Just a thought. In my experience. Postfix 2.4 has perfectly working
milter interface.  amavisd-milter sees to be stable enough too. And all
those ""reinjections"" are known as a major source of bugs including
open-relay vulnerabilities.

Do you really need to debug them?
